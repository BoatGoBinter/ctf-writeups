We are given a python file to read through to analyze Brian's security system. It has a username and a password that is created with if statements. Here is the solution. You can read the if statements and match them up with the password.

```
if username != "Br14n_th3_b3st_c4k3_b4k3r":
    print("‚ùå Go away, only Baker Brian has access!")
    exit()
```
This is before the password, meaning that the username is Br14n_th3_b3st_c4k3_b4k3r.
