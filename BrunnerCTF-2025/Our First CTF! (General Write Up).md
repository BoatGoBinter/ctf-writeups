# Introduction
BrunnerCTF was the first CTF my friend, "portablefan," and I had ever participated in. We are studying Computer Science and Data Science, respectively. With scarce cybersecurity knowledge, we decided to dive head first anyway. Let's see how we did!


<img width="700" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27b6b818-c633-4992-8bd1-d6faf3be0730" />

Hooray! Out of all the teams that captured at least one flag, we ranked 396 out of 1196, or roughly the top 33rd percentile!
---
In this writeup, I will go over all of the flags we captured (from least to most points, so easiest at start), as well as our thoughts and the methods we conducted in order to capture each flag.<br>
<sub><sub>The first two flags were verification, so I won't go over them, but for transparency, they were as follows:<br> 
<sub><sub>Sanity Check (10): Enter the flag given: brunner{n0w-y0u-kn0w-y0ur-C-T-F} <br>
<sub><sub>Join the Discord (20): Read the discord's rules and check the announcement where there is a hidden comment: brunner{1t5_4_P13C3_0f_c4K3_T0_B4k3_4_pr3TTy_C4k3!}.</sub>

# DoughBot (20 points)

```
Author: rvsmvs

Our state-of-the-art smart mixer, DoughBot, crashed during a routine kneading cycle.
Luckily, a technician was monitoring the device over UART and captured the memory output just before the reboot.

Analyze the captured dump and see what the DoughBot was trying to say before it rebooted.
```
In this challenge, we are given a bin file with a log dump:

Right before it is rebooted, we see a dev note with a bootleg flag: "YnJ1bm5lcnttMXgzZF9zMWduYWxzXzRfc3VyZX0=". 
We immediately recognized this as base64 and converted it:

# Where Robots Cannot Search (30)

```
Author: The Mikkel

Ahh, the Brunnerne company.
But they have a secret, hidden away from robot search.
```

In this challenge, we are greeted with a website this time.

The trick to this one is to read the title of the challenge: _Where Robots Cannot Search..._

One Google search later:

# The Great Mainframe Bake-off (30)

```
Author: H4N5

It's 1974. Deep inside the crusty vaults of CrumbTrust Bank, a covert team of COBOL developers and pastry chefs created a
failsafe for their most prized possession: The Marzipan Reverse Recipe.

This sacred document was too valuable to be stored on paper.
So, they did the unthinkable - they encoded it and buried it in the production mainframe under a fake batch job titled IEBCAKED.
Only those with knowledge of both banking ops and baking science could ever retrieve it.

Years later, the IEBCAKED job has mysteriously reappeared in the job output spool of an IBM z/OS LPAR.
But what's left is a string of mysterious byte codes.
It's clearly not hex, not ASCII... maybe something older... something only the graybeards of computing would recognize.

Can you decipher the original recipe and unlock the secret to the perfect butterbyte tart?

d0-85-97-89-83-85-d9-6d-85-a2-99-85-a5-85-d9-6d-95-81-97-89-a9-99-81-d4-6d-85-88-e3-6d-a2-c9-6d-a2-89-88-e3-6d-84-95-c1-6d-a2-85-94-81-99-c6-95-89-
81-d4-6d-95-d6-6d-f0-f7-f9-f1-6d-85-88-e3-6d-95-c9-6d-84-85-a2-e4-6d-a2-81-e6-6d-c3-c9-c4-c3-c2-c5-c0-99-85-95-95-a4-99-82
```

We know its a ciphered text. And we are given the year 1974. So, let's think about what byte codes were used in 1974 and prior? ASCII? They said no? Hmmm. Let's google.

<img width="600" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22bb46a2-5167-4a18-b089-70e435e592ce" />

EBCDIC it is. Let's decode it.

When we decode we got a string thats reversed. When we reverse we get the flag: brunner{EBCDIC_Was_Used_In_The_1970_On_MainFrames_And_This_Is_The_Marzipan_Reverse_Recipe}

# Baker Brian (30)
```
Author: Nissen

Baker Brian says he has a plan to make him super rich, but he refuses to share any details üò†
Can you access his Cake Vault where he keeps all his business secrets?

Info: The challenge has both a file download and a server to connect to. Please click "Start Challenge"
below and wait a minute for your team's challenge instance to start, then connect to the server from a terminal with the command that appears.

```

We are given a python file to read through to analyze Brian's security system. It has a username and a password that is created with if statements. Here is the solution. You can read the if statements and match them up with the password.

```
if username != "Br14n_th3_b3st_c4k3_b4k3r":
    print("‚ùå Go away, only Baker Brian has access!")
    exit()
```
This is before the password, meaning that the username is Br14n_th3_b3st_c4k3_b4k3r.

# Insanity Check (30)

```
Author: OddNorseman

Our CTF page is pretty cool, right? Nom nom nom
```

Go to https://ctf.brunnerne.dk/. 

we can go into the JavaScript code on the website. 

```
  let g = [
    84, 68,  67, 88, 88,  83, 68, 77,  79,  6,  67, 105, 82, 7,
    82, 105, 7,  66, 23,  23, 23, 105, 88,  6,  65, 105, 66, 68,
    79, 105, 66, 6,  105, 2,  85, 66,  67,  2,  90, 90,  79, 105,
    70, 90,  2,  79, 105, 66, 94, 5,   105, 85, 66, 80,  75
  ];
```

Each of these numbers is XOR-encoded using the number 54.
Decode Here:

```
g = g.map(j => j ^ 54); 

let decoded = g.map(L => String.fromCharCode(L)).join("");

console.log(decoded);
```
Output: brunner{y0u_d1d_1t!!!_n0w_try_t0_4ctu4lly_pl4y_th3_ctf}

# Cookie Jar (40)

```
Author: Quack

We just got our hands on grandma's legendary cookie jar! What delicious treats could she be hiding here?
```
We are given a webpage. 

<img width="500" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d48a34d-7b11-49bd-a9eb-bc944cc48b43" />

Initially we were stumped. There's nothing to do... However, portablefan caught on to the name of the challenge. _**Cookie**_ Jar. Cookies!

Change the false to true and we get:

# The Baking Case

```

So, this one took a while. The first thing we thought was reading the description. "Little by little" caught my eye. Neither of us are steganography experts so I googled "little by little steganography" and ended up with a result about "Least Significant Bit (LSB)". This brought us down a rabbithole that didn't give any help. 

Our next approach was to take the uppercase and lowercase and change them into zeros and ones. 

Here is the code I wrote.
```
a = "i UseD to coDE liKe A sLEEp-dEprIVed SqUirRel smasHInG keYs HOPinG BugS would dISApPear THrOugh fEAr tHeN i sPilled cOFfeE On mY LaPTop sCReameD iNTerNALly And bakeD BanaNa bREAd oUt oF PAnIc TuRNs OUT doUGh IS EasIEr tO dEbUG ThaN jaVASCrIPt Now I whIsPeR SWEEt NOtHIngs TO sOurDoUGh StARtERs aNd ThReATEN CrOissaNts IF they DoN'T rIsE My OVeN haS fEWeR CRasHEs tHAN mY oLD DEV sErvER aNd WHeN THInGS BurN i jUSt cAlL iT cARAMElIzEd FeatUReS no moRE meetInGS ThAt coUlD HAVE bEeN emailS JUst MufFInS THAt COulD HAvE BEen CupCAkes i OnCE tRIeD tO GiT PuSh MY cInnAmON rOLLs aND paNICkED WHEn I coUldn't reVErt ThEm NOw i liVe IN PeaCE uNLESs tHe yEast getS IDeas abOVe iTs StATion oR a COOkiE TrIES To sEgfAult my toOTH FILlings"
binary_str = ""

for i in a:
   if i.isupper():
     binary_str += "1"
   elif i.islower()
      binary_str += "0"

print(binary_str)
```

# Online Cake Flavour Shop

```
Author: olexmeister

Brunnerne made an online flavour shop! Your wildest dreams can be fulfilled, it's actually hard to WRAP your head AROUND how amazing this software is!
nc cake-flavour-shop.challs.brunnerne.xyz 33000

```

In this challenge, we open a TCP connection to the flavor shop server. We can only sample a few cake flavors. But the flavor we want is $100 and we can't afford it!

<img width="500" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f121548-1a61-456d-b8a2-62eeabde9708" />

Luckily in the the provided Python code we can see a very simple vulnerability. Overflow. It can only process an integer number. So let's input a number bigger than an integr for the amount of bruner flavors I want to test.
