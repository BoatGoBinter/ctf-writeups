# There Is a Lovely Land (100)

```
The Danish national anthem is called "Der er et yndigt land" ("There Is a Lovely Land"), and I fully agree.

A friend of mine took this picture, but I don't know the name of the bridge! Please help me find it so I can go see it!

Flag format: brunner{<bridge name in Danish in lowercase>}
```
Here is the bridge:

The strategy was simple. Go through Denmark's waterways and find bridges. What I didn't expect was to find it in the first try.

The reasoning behind choosing this location is likely based off a few things, but I'd likely attribute it to Geoguessing on Geoguessr.
My initial thought was that it can't be a river but rather a much larger body of water. The bridge has to be straight unlike the one south of it. And it should be in a more rural but still inner Denmark with land on both sides. That's how I landed on this bridge first try.

Flag: brunner{sallingsundbroen}

# Train Mania

```
Author: Quack

I recently stumpled upon this cool train! But I'd like to know a bit more about it...
Can you please tell me the operating company, model number and its maximum service speed (km/h in regular traffic)?

The flag format is brunner{OPERATOR-MODELNUMBER-SERVICESPEED}.
So if the operator you have found is DSB, the model number RB1, and the maximum service speed is 173 km/h, the flag would be brunner{DSB-RB1-173}.
```

We are given an mp4 of a train moving. One frame in the video was enough to give away very important details.

On the train it says "SJ", A Swedish train company. And on wikipedia we can find the train, the X2000.

Another search shows 200km/hr. 

So for our final flag: brunner{SJ-X2-200}
