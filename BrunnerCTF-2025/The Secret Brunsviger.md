# The Secret Brunsviger (50)

```
Author: Ha1fdan

I have intercepted encrypted HTTPS traffic from the secret brunsviger baking forum, but I need help decrypting it.
```

In this challenge, we are given 2 files, a packet capture and the SSL/TLS secrets log file, generated by NSS.

In order to get the flag, we use WireShark and open the TLS protocol on the packet capture and use the logs file as the Master-secret log filename.

The secret is encoded in base64. So we just decode it:

```
└─$ echo "YnJ1bm5lcntTM2NyM3RfQnJ1bnp2MWczcl9SM2MxcDNfRnIwbV9HcjRuZG00c19DMDBrYjAwa30=" | base64 -d
brunner{S3cr3t_Brunzv1g3r_R3c1p3_Fr0m_Gr4ndm4s_C00kb00k}          
```
Flag: brunner{S3cr3t_Brunzv1g3r_R3c1p3_Fr0m_Gr4ndm4s_C00kb00k}
